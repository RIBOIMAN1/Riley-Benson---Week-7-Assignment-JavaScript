                <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1> <!-- <h1> element describing the question -->
                <p>Something that worked pretty well during my eight week learning process in this course and aided my learning process was having the option to work from home. This has improved my time management and allows me to use my preferred home setup for this course, which is easier to use.</p> <!-- Paragraph contained within a <p> element explaining the answer -->

                <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1> <!-- <h1> element describing the question -->
                <p>Something that I would change about this course would be the homework load in this class. I am working all night doing this stuff and it would be nice to have a break sometimes. It is understandable though that this may not be possible to change.</p> <!-- Paragraph contained within a <p> element explaining the answer -->

                <p>I did end up learning what I expected to learn in this course. I have learned some pretty cool CSS tricks in just a short amount of time, and I hope to put these tricks to good use later down the road.</p> <!-- Paragraph contained within a <p> element explaining the answer -->

                <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1> <!-- <h1> element describing the question -->
                <p>Some concepts that were new to me were the creation of grid layouts, Bootstrap, and the plethora of available options for third-party libraries to choose from. This really opened my eyes to both new options for my code and ways to make otherwise tedious code much easier to apply. I have already understood the concept of colors, how to position elements, the concept of accessibility, and general typography pretty well coming into this course.</p> <!-- Paragraph contained within a <p> element explaining the answer -->
